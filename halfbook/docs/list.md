# List of Incomplete Books

| Author         | Book     | Notes|
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Kingfisher, T | Clockwork Boys| Like Hyperion, the book just ends; but unlike Hyperion, the story is boring and characters dull. It pissed me enough to never buy another Kingfisher book    |
| McClellan, Brian |   Promise of Blood | Another book with not a SINGLE FUCKING plot point resolved; literally nothing changes by the end of the book. Actually, not true; in the last few chapters, the authors tries to bring in a "surprise" twist, but rather than _Sixth Sense_ it feels more like _Lady in the Water_ |
|Scalzi, John| The Collapsing Empire | Multiple 1 star reviews point out this is just an introduction to the world, with no real story. And another reviewer complains even the third book ends badly. A shame, as normally Scalzi writes independent books.|
| Simmons, Dan  |  Hyperion | You really need to buy the Ominbus edition, which has both the books togther. The story is complete. I recommend this book, as it's an excellent SciFi series, that on first look sounds like horror/dark fantasy. |
| Tripathi, Amish|  Immortals of Melhua | This book literally ends in the middle of  a sentence; the author was clearly fucking with us |
| Wexler, Django | Ashes of the Sun | What to say? Lots of confusing plot points. At one stage, it looks like all of them will be resolved, but then we end in the middle of a chapter. And we're told we have to wait 1-2 years for the next book. No thanks. |
