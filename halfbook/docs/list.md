# List of Incomplete Books

| Book         | Author     | Notes|
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Hyperion     | Dan Simmons     |  You really need to buy the Ominbus edition, which has both the books togther. The story is complete      |
| Clockwork Boys      | T Kingfisher | Like Hyperion above, the book just ends, and pissed me enough to never buy another Kingfisher book       |
| Immortals of Melhua| Amish Tripathi | This book literally ends in the middle of  a sentence; the author was clearly fucking with us|
| Promise of Blood| Brian McClellan | Another book with not a SINGLE FUCKING plot point resolved; literally nothing changes by the end of the book. Actually, not true; in the last chapter, the author pulls something out of his ass, but I didn't see it as a proper ending. And I'm not buying the later books.|
