# List of Incomplete Books

| Author         | Book     | Notes|
|--------------|-----------|------------|
|Boyett, Steven|The Architect of Sleep| by reddit user /u/Yard_Sailor: "Not only did the complete lack of ending piss me off to no end, but the reasons behind the lack of sequels range from ‚Äúa shitty publishing company‚Äù to ‚Äúan overwhelming amount of furries."|
|Campbell, Nenia|Bleeds my Desire| by reddit user /u/ncity_bruh :  "actually read a dark vampire romance a month or two ago that was like this. loved it but cliffhanger was weird. the whole story is the girl being trained by a vampire to kill another vamp but when we do get to the point where she is finally at that vamps house to kill him, the book suddenly ended in a rlly weird place. theres a second book coming out but ofc was a bit annoyed with this."|
| Kingfisher, T | Clockwork Boys| Like Hyperion, the book just ends; but unlike Hyperion, the story is boring and characters dull. It pissed me enough to never buy another Kingfisher book    |
|Jones, Lena | The Secret Key (Agatha Oddly) | As a Goodreads review points out, the supposed "mystery" book ends without revealing who the villain is. But that's fine, you can buy books 2 & 3 to find out! No thanks |
| McClellan, Brian |   Promise of Blood | Another book with not a SINGLE FUCKING plot point resolved; literally nothing changes by the end of the book. Actually, not true; in the last few chapters, the authors tries to bring in a "surprise" twist, but rather than _Sixth Sense_ it feels more like _Lady in the Water_ |
|Murakami, Haruki|Norwegian Wood| Suggested by reddit user /u/capedcr|
|Novik, Naomi| A Deadly Education| From reddit user /u/Thisisme123321: "Both books of Naomi Novik‚Äôs Deadly Education series üôÑ after she cliff hung me on the first, I refuse to start the 2nd until the 3rd/final book comes out next year. But from reviews, I know book 2 is a cliffhanger as well." |
|Scalzi, John| The Collapsing Empire | Multiple 1 star reviews point out this is just an introduction to the world, with no real story. And another reviewer complains even the third book ends badly. A shame, as normally Scalzi writes independent books.|
| Simmons, Dan  |  Hyperion | You really need to buy the Ominbus edition, which has both the books togther. The story is complete. I recommend this book, as it's an excellent SciFi series, that on first look sounds like horror/dark fantasy. |
|Socha, Walt| Conflict| by reddit user /u/Moonreaper666|
| Tripathi, Amish|  Immortals of Melhua | This book literally ends in the middle of  a sentence; the author was clearly fucking with us |
| Wexler, Django | Ashes of the Sun | What to say? Lots of confusing plot points. At one stage, it looks like all of them will be resolved, but then we end in the middle of a chapter. And we're told we have to wait 1-2 years for the next book. No thanks. |
